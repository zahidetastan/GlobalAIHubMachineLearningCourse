    "1) How would you define Machine Learning?  \n",
    "2) What are the differences between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning? Specify example 3 algorithms   for each of these.  \n",
    "3) What are the test and validation set, and why would you want to use them?  \n",
    "4) What are the main preprocessing steps? Explain them in detail. Why we need to prepare our data?  \n",
    "5) How you can explore and analyse countionus and discrete variables?  \n",
    "6) Analyse the plot given below. (What is the plot and variable type, check the distribution and make comment about how you can preproccess it.) "

    "   - Data cleaning: Fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers, and resolve inconsistencies.\n",
